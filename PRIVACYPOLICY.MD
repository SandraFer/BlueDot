# BlueDot Privacy Policy

The BlueDot Python library and Android app do not store your personal data. That is it!

There is nowhere to store your data, no database, no server. Even if Rick Astley asked [really really nicely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to see your data it couldn't be given it to him.

For the purposes of utmost transparency...  The android app will store 2 items of non-personal data, [preferences for using the default port and a preferred port](https://github.com/martinohanlon/BlueDot/blob/master/clients/android/app/src/main/java/com/stuffaboutcode/bluedot/SettingsActivity.java) (if you change them from the default) in a [shared preferences file](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences).
