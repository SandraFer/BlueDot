Bluetooth Comm API
==================

Blue Dot also contains a useful :mod:`btcomm` API for sending and
receiving data over Bluetooth.

For normal use of Blue Dot, this API doesn't need to be used, but its included
in the documentation for info and for those who might need a simple Bluetooth
communication library.
